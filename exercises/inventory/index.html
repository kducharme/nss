<!-- To practice working with data, you are going to build a home inventory program. You will create a database of unique, or cool, items in your home, their location, and why they are special. By the end of this practice exercise, you will be able to store a JSON database in the local storage of your browser so that it can be retrieved, and modified again, at any time in the future. -->
